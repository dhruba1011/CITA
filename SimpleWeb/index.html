      The youngest of 13 surviving children, Tagore (nicknamed "Rabi") was born
      on 7 May 1861 in the Jorasanko mansion in Calcutta,[23] the son of
      Debendranath Tagore (1817–1905) and Sarada Devi (1830–1875).[b]

      smiling, stands with the hand on the hip and elbow turned outward with a
      shawl draped over his shoulders and in Bengali formal wear. In front of
      him, the woman, seated, is in elaborate dress and shawl; she leans against
      a carved table supporting a vase and flowing leaves. Tagore and his wife

      Tagore was raised mostly by servants; his mother had died in his early
      childhood and his father travelled widely.[29] The Tagore family was at
      the forefront of the Bengal renaissance. They hosted the publication of
      literary magazines; theatre and recitals of Bengali and Western classical
      music featured there regularly. Tagore's father invited several
      professional Dhrupad musicians to stay in the house and teach Indian
      classical music to the children.[30] Tagore's oldest brother Dwijendranath
      was a philosopher and poet. Another brother, Satyendranath, was the first
      Indian appointed to the elite and formerly all-European Indian Civil
      Service. Yet another brother, Jyotirindranath, was a musician, composer,
      and playwright.[31] His sister Swarnakumari became a novelist.[32]
      Jyotirindranath's wife Kadambari Devi, slightly older than Tagore, was a
      dear friend and powerful influence. Her abrupt suicide in 1884, soon after
      he married, left him profoundly distraught for years.[33]

      Tagore largely avoided classroom schooling and preferred to roam the manor
      or nearby Bolpur and Panihati, which the family visited.[34][35] His
      brother Hemendranath tutored and physically conditioned him—by having him
      swim the Ganges or trek through hills, by gymnastics, and by practising
      judo and wrestling. He learned drawing, anatomy, geography and history,
      literature, mathematics, Sanskrit, and English—his least favourite
      subject.[36] Tagore loathed formal education—his scholarly travails at the
      local Presidency College spanned a single day. Years later he held that
      proper teaching does not explain things; proper teaching stokes
      curiosity:[37]
